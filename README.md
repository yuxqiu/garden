# Toys

This repository contains some C++ projects I made in my spare time. They are very rudimentary and crude and should only be used as toys.

# Table of Contents

1. `huffman`: a C++ implementation of Huffman Encoding
2. `finite-state-machine`: a C++ implementation of some Finite State Machines
3. `MyMatrix`: a toy matrix implementation
4. `tiny-fmt`: A simple implementation of C++ `format`
5. `q-benchmark`: q-benchmark is a command-line benchmark tool inspired by hyperfine
6. `cpp-as-rust`: a set of header files that aims to provide Rust-like programming experience in C++
