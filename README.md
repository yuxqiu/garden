# ðŸŒ± Garden

Welcome to my **digital garden**! This repository is a curated collection of my projects, talks, and other artifacts I've created over time. Think of it as an evolving space where I document and share my work.

## ðŸ“‚ Explore

Feel free to browse through the folders - each one contains its own `README` with more details about its contents. I hope you find something valuable!
