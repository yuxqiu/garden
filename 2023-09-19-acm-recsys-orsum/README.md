## truelearn

This folder hosts the slide from my talk at the 2023 ACM RecSys [ORSUM](https://orsum.inesctec.pt/orsum2023/) workshop. The talk introduces a Python machine learning library called [truelearn](https://github.com/TrueLearnAI/truelearn) that can model a learner's knowledge and have potential use in educational recommender systems.
